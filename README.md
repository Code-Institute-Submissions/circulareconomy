### A platform about circular econony and for mapping circular initiative in the Stockholm area
Circeco aim to highlight and promote the network of existing circular initiative in the Stockholm area by mappiing and organising those by sector. The website also wants to inform about what kind of circular action the user can take in order to have a sustaianble alternative to the common consumption model take-make-dispose. 

## UX
The design goal is to create a sleak, simple and straighforward user interface. The use of colors is kept at minimum that a part from the use of black and white, with also the employment of a type of red to highlight and catch attention and a type of green/blue in different shade to represent different levels of circularity. This is also a reminder of the logo and of the sustaianbility theme often associate with green. The red color is also a reminder of the state of environmental emergency and the action to take. The colors empolyed and the font together create a specific custom theme recognisible among other website. This same custom theme can be used for the further development of website. 
Everything is always accessible thanks to the sticky navigation bar at the top. The website at the moment develops over one page through different sections so each section can be reached by a click on the navigation bar. 
The css hover animation for the circular action cards clarify the terminology used without clatter the website with eccessive writing, while css animation of 'rotating word' for circular action is eyescatching while simply state the what is meant by circular actions and what they are. Other css animations on hover like on the logo, navigation bar and on other buttons allow the user to quickly understand the interactivity of those elements. 
The main title also uses an animation but from JavaScript in orther to understand the meaning of the acronym circeco again without clattering with too much writing but instead with an amusing animation. There are also two Javascript files that help the user to better navigate throughout the page a part from the navigation bar. One is the scrollspy, which allow the see on the navigation bar sticky to the top in which section of the website the user is. The second JavaScript code helps the user to scroll and snap to a section of the website. This is particularly useful for the map section so that the user can focus on interacting with the map without basically having the page moving too much. 
Finally, although the map section has to rely on external resources, It was adapted to fit the website same rules for style, accessibility and amusement so continuity is assurance. 

### Map functionality

The main functionality of the website is the circular atlas. It is map with layers of points that indicates circular initiative in the Stockholm area. By clicking on the points on the map a box appear with info about the initiative and their website. The list next to map have several features:
